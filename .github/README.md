# Introduction üìï

It is _a massive_ rewrite of original forked project [yoshina](https://github.com/shysecre/yoshina), which supported only Spotify tracks and played them via Spotify desktop app. <br />
This version supports both YouTube and Spotify tracks and plays them via web player. (Hosted on your local machine) <br />
It also has `/widget` endpoint that you can use to display the current song on your stream. <br />

# Description üìù

Simply putting, it's a bot that listens to twitch chat and reacts to custom rewards. <br />
When someone redeems the reward, it will add the track to the player queue. <br />
Player will play tracks in order they were added. <br />
You as streamer can skip tracks, pause, resume, stop player from browser <br />
